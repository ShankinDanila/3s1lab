# 3s1lab
my first lab in the third semester
This is my first c++ program. do not judge strictly :) 

A rectangular strongly sparse matrix of integers [aij], i = 1,..., m, j = 1,..., n is entered from the input stream. The values of m and n are not known in advance and are entered from the input stream.
Form a vector {bi}, i = 1,..., m, the i-th element of which is equal to the sum of those elements of the i-th row of the original matrix, in which the sum of the digits used in writing the number coincides with the sum of the digits of the first element of the same row of the original matrix.
Output the original matrix and the resulting vector to the output stream with the necessary comments.
